## üìë Description

A clean white theme for Wikipedia. Inspired by the [1911 theme](https://blog.weare1910.com/post/75576312730/a-readable-wikipedia) and [Wikiwand](https://blog.weare1910.com/post/75576312730/a-readable-wikipedia). It is cleaner and uses serif font to make the content look more academic.


## üíæ Installation

1. Install a css injection plugin for your web browser such as [Stylebot](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/stylebot-web/) or [Styler](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/styler-pro/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search).
2. Go on wikipedia, and open the window of the plugin that you installed
3. Paste the content of [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Klemet/Wikipedia-Clean-White/master/styles.css) into the css window of the plugin that you installed
4. Congratulations ! Now, wikipedia should look beautiful !
